Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
